# ContainerEnum

# Why?
Haven't found a script to enumerate a Container from within the Container. Should be a bit like linenum. Still work in progress.

# What?
Just run the script via bash containerenum.sh or wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3sjay/ContainerEnum/master/containerenum.sh | sh
